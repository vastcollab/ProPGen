## Evolutionary dynamics under phenotypic uncertainty 

Descriptions of each folder: 

* configs: simulation config files to set parameters
* data: contains adjaceny matrices, mapping probabilities, and reproduction probabilities for each simulation
* notebooks: mathematica notebooks for theory
* plots: jupyter notebooks with plotting code for figures in the manuscript
* utils: helper functions for running simulation code and computing theoretically-predicted frequencies

Descriptions of other files:

.py files contain simulation code for each category of simulation (e.g. buoy, bridge)
.sh files run multiple trials and parameter settings of a given simulation file
